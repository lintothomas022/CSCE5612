On the first day of the course, the professor discussed the idea of working on a project. 
I proposed an idea focused on preventing explosions in EV batteries due to thermal runaway. 
I shared the concept with Sai Vijay Sankar Bheemana, and he was excited to collaborate.
We decided to divide the work: he would handle the machine learning aspect, while I would focus on designing the system.
